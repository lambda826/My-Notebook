Design a system for an event planner where a user can create an event and add other google users to it, the users can then vote for a venue to host the event at. All users should be notified once the event is decided.

I struggled a lot to define data models and requirements for the system, interviewer mostly said to focus on event creation/assignement and voting and ignore notificaions until the end.
