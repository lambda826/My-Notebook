# My Answer
## Tell me about yourself
I worked in China for 4 years as a fullstack engineer. To seek more challenging opportunity, I quit and came to U.S. to purse my master degree, and then Joined Amazon. I have been working at Amazon for 2 and half years. My first team was under e-commerce, and current team is under AWS RDS. I have comparatively diverse experiences with building 2B and 2C systems, infrastrures and products. From technical perspective, I am super passionate about cutting technologies, and I like dive deep. And I am very willing to share or transfer my knowledge to my teams and help the whole team growth.

## Why do you want to leave your current role?
We just completed and launched the Promotion Shopping Page project world wide, and I am seeking for greater challenges for my carreer from leadership's perspective. Specifically more about technical leadership and technical management.

## Tell me about a time you disaggreed with someone
At the very beginning of the Promotion Shopping Page Project, we were discussing what tech stack that we should use. Since my team was more about backend, we don't have much fullstack exprience before. For front end, what we own is the promotion widget on Amazon retail website which is written in JSP.
