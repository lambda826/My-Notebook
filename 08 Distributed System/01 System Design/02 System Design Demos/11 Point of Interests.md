## Algorithm Model: How to Find NearBy?
### Option 1: SQL Solution
1. We store  `Latitude (X)` / `Longitute (Y)` for each entity 
2. Do a SQL query for `NearBy (D)` query: `([X + D, X - D], [Y + D, Y - D])`
3. Low performance: O(N)

### Option 2: Grid
![POI Grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lambda826/My-Notebook/master/08%20Distributed%20System/01%20System%20Design/02%20System%20Design%20Demos/resource/POI%20Grid.png)
1. Divide the whole map into grids.
2. Group locations into grids.
3. Based on given `Location` and `Radius`, find all neighbouring grids.
4. Aggregate all `Locations` in those grids.
5. We can cache the grids (`GridId`, `List<Location>`) in memory.

Problem
- Location is not uniformly distributed among grids.
- This problem can be solved if we can dynamically adjust our grid size such that whenever we have a grid with a lot of places we break it down to create smaller grids.

### Option 3: QuadTree (Dynamic Size Grids)
![QuadTree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lambda826/My-Notebook/master/999%20Resource/QuadTree.png)
 - Assume we donâ€™t want to have more than 500 places in a grid so that we can have a faster searching. So, whenever a grid reaches this limit, we break it down into four grids of equal size and distribute places among them.



### Option 4: Hilbert Curve


# Follow-up
How can we paritition database?
 - Sharding based on regions
	 - Hotspot issue (read).
	 - Uniform distribution (write). 
 - Sharding based on `LocationID`
	 - Have to query all db instance and aggregate the results

How can we do a search and present the results on the map?
 - Build `inverted index` on top of the entities, whose `key` is the **key words** and `value` is the properties of the entities.
