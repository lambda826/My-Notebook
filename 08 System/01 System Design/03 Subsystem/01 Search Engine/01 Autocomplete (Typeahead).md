# What is Autocomplete (Typeahead)
- Autocomplete is a popular feature of search engines.
- As the user types something in the search box, this feature creates suggestions to complete the sentence for what the user has already typed.
	- These suggestions come from the queries that users have already searched in that search engine and the popularity of these searches.
	- A query that has been searched several times will appear among the top suggestions.
