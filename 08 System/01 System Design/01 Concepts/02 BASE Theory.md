Basically Available
 - Compromise on response time.
 - Compromise on function loss.

Soft State  (weak state)
 - The state of the data could change without application interactions due to eventual consistency.
 - Allows the data in the system to have an intermediate state, and considers that this state does not affect the overall availability of the system, that is, it allows data delay in the data copies of multiple different nodes.

Eventually Consistent
