**Atomicity**
 - Atomicity means that you guarantee that either all of the transaction succeeds or none of it does.

**Consistency**
 - This ensures that you guarantee that all data will be consistent.
 - All data will be valid according to all defined rules, including any constraints, cascades, and triggers that have been applied on the database.

**Isolation**
 - Guarantees that all transactions will occur in isolation.
 - No transaction will be affected by any other transaction.

**Durability**
 - Durability means that, once a transaction is committed, it will remain in the system – even if there’s a system crash immediately following the transaction.
